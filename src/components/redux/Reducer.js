              "Missing Person: Dedrick Smith was last seen on October 3, 2006, when he left his family’s Winston-Salem, North Carolina home driving a turquoise 1993 Pontiac Grand Am with North Carolina license plates numbered NYB3645. \n\nAWP found Dedrick and his car underwater 16-years later on April 01, 2022. \n\nThis video documents Adventures With Purpose's search for Dedrick Smith, using the clues left behind with an emphasis on the AWP's 5-mile search strategy.\n\n- Where were they last seen?\n- Where did they live?\n- Where did they work?\n- Where did they go to school? \n\n❤️..

These debilitating symptoms blur the line between what is real and what isn't, making it difficult for the person to lead a typical life.\n\nWe believe that Dedrick's schizophrenia is what led him to accidentally drive his car into Winston Lake 16-years earlier. \n\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to Dedrick's family during this difficult time.\n\nHug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them.\n\n❤️..
